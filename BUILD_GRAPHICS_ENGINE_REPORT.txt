===========================================
  GAME GRAPHICS ENGINE REBUILD COMPLETE
===========================================

PROJECT: HoverRace AI
DATE: 2025-11-14 08:01:19
TARGET: Force use of new SDL2Graphics rendering engine

=== BUILD CONFIGURATION ===
- Configuration: Release
- Platform: Win32
- Graphics Backend: SDL2Graphics (via _HAVE_SDL2 preprocessor define)
- Fallback Graphics: DirectDraw
- Graphics Entry Point: VideoBuffer::SetVideoMode()

=== PREPROCESSOR DEFINES ===
VideoServices.dll - Debug:   WIN32;_DEBUG;_WINDOWS;MR_VIDEO_SERVICES;_HAVE_SDL2;_AFXDLL
VideoServices.dll - Release: WIN32;NDEBUG;_WINDOWS;MR_VIDEO_SERVICES;_HAVE_SDL2;_AFXDLL

=== SUCCESSFULLY BUILT BINARIES ===
[SUCCESS] VideoServices.dll     (410624 bytes) - NEW GRAPHICS ENGINE MODULE
[SUCCESS] Game2.exe             (474112 bytes) - MAIN GAME EXECUTABLE
[SUCCESS] Model.dll             (151040 bytes) - GAME MODELS MODULE
[SUCCESS] Util.dll              (105472 bytes) - UTILITY LIBRARY
[SUCCESS] MainCharacter.dll     (98816 bytes)  - CHARACTER MODULE
[SUCCESS] ObjFac1.dll           (113152 bytes) - OBJECT FACTORY

=== GRAPHICS ENGINE ACTIVATION FLOW ===
1. Game2.exe starts
2. MR_GameApp initializes
3. SetVideoMode() called in VideoBuffer::SetVideoMode()
4. InitializeSDL2Graphics() attempts to initialize
5. If successful: SDL2Graphics adapter provides buffer and rendering pipeline
6. If failed: Falls back to DirectDraw
7. Palette created for color conversion (8-bit game -> 32-bit display)

=== CONFIGURATION VERIFIED ===
✓ SDL2Graphics enabled via _HAVE_SDL2 preprocessor define
✓ SDL2 libraries linked: SDL2.lib, SDL2main.lib
✓ GLEW linked: glew32.lib (for graphics context)
✓ OpenGL support enabled: opengl32.lib
✓ VideoServices.dll built with new graphics engine
✓ All dependencies resolved and linked correctly

=== READY FOR LAUNCH ===
The game is now configured to use the new graphics engine.
Launch from: C:\originalhr2\HoverRaceAI\Release\Game2.exe
